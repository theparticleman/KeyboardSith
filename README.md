Keyboard Sith
============

A tool to disable your mouse in order to force you to learn keyboard shortcuts.

Learning keyboard shortcuts is a great way to increase your productivity, whatever tool you're using. Keyboard Sith is here to help you! Using a global shortcut key, you can disable or enable the mouse, forcing yourself to learn some keyboard shortcuts. It's a great tool to turn on sometimes so you can actually see how much you use the mouse during the day. 

After starting the application, disable the mouse by pushing CTRL+Shift+ALT+F11. That will force your mouse cursor to stay within the bounds of the Keyboard Sith window. You can use the same shortcut to release the cursor. There is a system tray icon you can glance at to let you know if the cursor is captured (red light saber) or free (blue light saber). When you free the mouse you even get a handy little message to help encourage you to use the keyboard more:

Peace is a lie; there is only passion.
Through passion, I gain strength.
Through strength, I gain power.
Through power, I gain victory.
Through victory, my chains are broken.
The Keyboard shall free me.
